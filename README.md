Shop Customer Waiting and Clerk Idle Time Simulation in Excel

## Ivan Sempebwa
### Coursework for Modeling and Simulation

Simulation of the checkout process in an e-commerce store (such as a small gift shop). 
The setup includes one cashier and one line of customers waiting for service. The objective is to determine two key performance measures:
- The average time a customer spends in the system (both waiting and being serviced).
- The percentage of time that the checkout clerk is idle.

Requirement
- Simulate 20 customers.
- Simulate for 3 hours.
- Use MS Excelâ€™s Data Table to generate 50 replications of the simulation.
